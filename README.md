# The Game of War
deployed URL: https://tmurphy3.github.io/game-of-war.github.io/

Two players start the game by splitting a deck of 52 standard playing cards evenly. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them. The objective of the game is to gather all 52 cards by taking them from your opponent.

## Rules

-Randomly assign 26 cards to each player
-Each player turns one of their cards face-up, the person with the higher value wins and puts both cards on the bottom of their deck in a random order
If the players have cards of the same value War is declared. The players put the top card of their deck face-down and then turn the next card of their deck face-up. The player with the higher card takes all 6 cards. If the players turn over cards of the same value, War is declared again and the process continues until one player wins.
If a player has fewer than three cards remaining in their deck and War is declared, they use the last card in their deck for the purpose of determining the winner
A player wins if they have all 52 cards in their deck
